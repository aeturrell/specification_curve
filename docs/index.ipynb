    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When specifying a causal model, modellers have a number of options. These can be informed by field intelligence, priors, and even misguided attempts to find a significant result. Even with the best of intentions, research teams can reach entirely different conclusions using the same, or similar, data because of different choices made in preparing data or in modelling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically this happens when there isn’t a clear way to do \"feature engineering\" on the data or the data are imperfect in some way. For example, you have a high frequency time series which needs to be aggregated to a lower frequency: you could take the maximum, the minimum, or the average over each high frequency time period. A different choice may be appropriate in different settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's formal evidence that researchers really do make different decisions; one study [@silberzahn2018many] gave the same research question---whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to players with dark skin tones than to players with light skin tones---to 29 different teams. From the abstract of that paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "So not only can different decisions made, but there seems to be no clearly identifiable reason for them!\n",
    "\n",
    "There have since been a number of papers that find similar conclusions [@huntington2021influence].\n",
    "\n",
    "Specification curves have been invented [@simonsohn2020specification] as a way to better grasp the garden of forking paths that analysts face, and help them show how sensitive their results are to alternative specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than one piece of software [@masur2019specr] has appeared to help researchers and analysts use this technique: **specification curve** is one such package!"
