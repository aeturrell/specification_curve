    "text": "Introduction\nWhen specifying a causal model, modellers have a number of options. These can be informed by field intelligence, priors, and even misguided attempts to find a significant result. Even with the best of intentions, research teams can reach entirely different conclusions using the same, or similar, data because of different choices made in preparing data or in modelling it.\nTypically this happens when there isn’t a clear way to do “feature engineering” on the data or the data are imperfect in some way. For example, you have a high frequency time series which needs to be aggregated to a lower frequency: you could take the maximum, the minimum, or the average over each high frequency time period. A different choice may be appropriate in different settings.\nThere’s formal evidence that researchers really do make different decisions; one study (Silberzahn et al. 2018) gave the same research question—whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to players with dark skin tones than to players with light skin tones—to 29 different teams. From the abstract of that paper:\n\nAnalytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability.\n\nSo not only can different decisions made, but there seems to be no clearly identifiable reason for them!\nThere have since been a number of papers that find similar conclusions (Huntington-Klein et al. 2021).\nSpecification curves have been invented (Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson 2020) as a way to better grasp the garden of forking paths that analysts face, and help them show how sensitive their results are to alternative specifications.\nMore than one piece of software (Masur and Scharkow 2019) has appeared to help researchers and analysts use this technique: specification curve is one such package!"

Blue or red markers and error bars show whether the coefficient is positive and significant (at the 0.05 level) or red and significant, respectively.\nYou can also specify the same model by passing a string to the formula API. This takes specifications in the form:\n“endogenous ~ exogenous + controls to always include + controls”\nwith any alternatives given by the “|” character.\nFor example:\n“y1 | y2 ~ x1 | x2 | x3 + c1 + c2 + c3 | c4”\nwould run specifications of y1, y2 on x1, x2, with c1 and c2 always included as controls and c3 and c4 included controls that are included combinatorially.\nHere’s an example:\n\ndf = specy.load_example_data1()\nsc = specy.SpecificationCurve(df=df, formula=\"y1 ~ x1 | x2 + group1 + c1 | c2\")\nsc.fit()\nsc.plot()\n\nFit complete"

The programme then automatically performs all of possible regressions of endogeneous variables on exogeneous variables and controls.

Blue or red markers and error bars show whether the coefficient is positive and significant (at the 0.05 level) or red and significant, respectively.\nYou can also specify models with the formula API. An example string would be “y1 | y2 ~ x1 | x2 | x3 + c1 + c2 + c3 | c4”. This would produce a specification curve in which there two endogenous variables, two exogenous variables, two variables that are always included (c1 and c2), and two controls that are included in all possible combinations.\nHere’s an example, for which we first generate some data.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Set seed for random numbers\nseed_for_prng = 78557\n# prng=probabilistic random number generator\nprng = np.random.default_rng(seed_for_prng)\n\n# generate some fake data\nn_samples = 1000\nx_2 = prng.integers(2, size=n_samples)\nx_1 = prng.random(size=n_samples)\nx_3 = prng.integers(3, size=n_samples)\nx_4 = prng.random(size=n_samples)\nx_5 = x_1 + 0.05 * np.random.randn(n_samples)\nx_beta = -1 - 3.5 * x_1 + 0.2 * x_2 + 0.3 * x_3  # NB: coefficient is -3.5\nprob = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x_beta))\ny = prng.binomial(n=1, p=prob, size=n_samples)\ny2 = prng.binomial(n=1, p=prob * 0.98, size=n_samples)\ndf_logit = pd.DataFrame(\n    [x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, y, y2], [\"x_1\", \"x_2\", \"x_3\", \"x_4\", \"x_5\", \"y\", \"y2\"]\n).T\n\n\nsc_form = specy.SpecificationCurve(\n    df_logit, formula=\"y | y2 ~ x_1 | x_5 + x_2 + x_3 | x_4\"\n)\nsc_form.fit()\nsc_form.plot()\n\nFit complete\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that “x_2” is included in all specifications."
