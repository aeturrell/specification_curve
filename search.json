    "text": "Basic Use\nHere’s an example of using Specification Curve. Note that, in the below, we can pass strings or lists of string into the arguments of the class SpecificationCurve. The programme then automatically performs all of possible regressions of endogeneous variables on exogeneous variables and controls. The estimate that is picked out is the coefficient on the given combination of endogeneous and exogenous variables (with conditioning on the given controls).\nIf a control variable is categorical, rather than continuous, it will be treated as a fixed effect.\n\nimport specification_curve as sc\n\ndf = sc.load_example_data1()\ny_endog = \"y1\"  # endogeneous variable\nx_exog = \"x1\"  # exogeneous variable\ncontrols = [\"c1\", \"c2\", \"group1\", \"group2\"]\nsco = sc.SpecificationCurve(\n    df,\n    y_endog,\n    x_exog,\n    controls,\n)\nsco.fit()\nsco.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrey squares (black lines when there are many specifications) show whether a variable is included in a specification or not. Blue or red markers and error bars show whether the coefficient is positive and significant (at the 0.05 level) or red and significant, respectively.\nYou can also specify models with the formula API. An example string would be “y1 | y2 ~ x1 | x2 | x3 + c1 + c2 + c3 | c4”. This would produce a specification curve in which there two endogenous variables, two exogenous variables, two variables that are always included (c1 and c2), and two controls that are included in all possible combinations.\nHere’s an example, for which we first generate some data.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Set seed for random numbers\nseed_for_prng = 78557\n# prng=probabilistic random number generator\nprng = np.random.default_rng(seed_for_prng)\n\n# generate some fake data\nn_samples = 1000\nx_2 = prng.integers(2, size=n_samples)\nx_1 = prng.random(size=n_samples)\nx_3 = prng.integers(3, size=n_samples)\nx_4 = prng.random(size=n_samples)\nx_5 = x_1 + 0.05 * np.random.randn(n_samples)\nx_beta = -1 - 3.5 * x_1 + 0.2 * x_2 + 0.3 * x_3  # NB: coefficient is -3.5\nprob = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x_beta))\ny = prng.binomial(n=1, p=prob, size=n_samples)\ny2 = prng.binomial(n=1, p=prob * 0.98, size=n_samples)\ndf_logit = pd.DataFrame(\n    [x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, y, y2], [\"x_1\", \"x_2\", \"x_3\", \"x_4\", \"x_5\", \"y\", \"y2\"]\n).T\n\n\nsc_form = sc.SpecificationCurve(\n    df_logit, formula=\"y | y2 ~ x_1 | x_5 + x_2 + x_3 | x_4\"\n)\nsc_form.fit()\nsc_form.plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that “x_2” is included in all specifications."

    "text": "Introduction\nWhen specifying a causal model, modellers have a number of options. These can be informed by field intelligence, priors, and even misguided attempts to find a significant result. Even with the best of intentions, research teams can reach entirely different conclusions using the same, or similar, data because of different choices made in preparing data or in modelling it.\nTypically this happens when there isn’t a clear way to do “feature engineering” on the data or the data are imperfect in some way. For example, you have a high frequency time series which needs to be aggregated to a lower frequency: you could take the maximum, the minimum, or the average over each high frequency time period. A different choice may be appropriate in different settings.\nThere’s formal evidence that researchers really do make different decisions; one study (Silberzahn et al. 2018) gave the same research question—whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to players with dark skin tones than to players with light skin tones—to 29 different teams. From the abstract of that paper:\n\nAnalytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability.\n\nSo not only can different decisions made, but there seems to be no clearly identifiable reason for them!\nThere have since been a number of papers that find similar conclusions (Huntington-Klein et al. 2021).\nSpecification curves have been invented (Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson 2020) as a way to better grasp the garden of forking paths that analysts face, and help them show how sensitive their results are to alternative specifications.\nMore than one piece of software (Masur and Scharkow 2019) has appeared to help researchers and analysts use this technique: specification curve is one such package!"

Blue or red markers and error bars show whether the coefficient is positive and significant (at the 0.05 level) or red and significant, respectively.\nYou can also specify the same model by passing a string to the formula API. This takes specifications in the form:\n“endogenous ~ exogenous + controls to always include + controls”\nwith any alternatives given by the “|” character.\nFor example:\n“y1 | y2 ~ x1 | x2 | x3 + c1 + c2 + c3 | c4”\nwould run specifications of y1, y2 on x1, x2, with c1 and c2 always included as controls and c3 and c4 included controls that are included combinatorially.\nHere’s an example:\n\ndf = sc.load_example_data1()\nsco = sc.SpecificationCurve(df=df, formula=\"y1 ~ x1 | x2 + group1 + c1 | c2\")\nsco.fit()\nsco.plot()"

It’s make clean to remove the existing README.\nTo publish new docs to GitHub Pages (where the documentation is displayed as web pages), it’s make publish—but only devs with admin rights will be able to execute this.\n\n\n\nRun the full test suite:\n$ uv run nox\nList the available Nox sessions:\n$ uv run nox --list-sessions\nYou can also run a specific Nox session. For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:\n$ uv run nox --session=tests\nUnit tests are located in the tests directory, and are written using the pytest testing framework.\nYou may need to use, for example, uv run nox to ensure that the tests are run in the right environment.\nFor the pre-commit checks, use\n$ uv run pre-commit run --all-files\n\n\n\nOpen a pull request to submit changes to this project.\nYour pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:\n\nThe Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.\nInclude unit tests. This project aims to maintain 96% code coverage.\nIf your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.\nRun make to generate the new documentation.\nRun the pre-commit suite before committing.\n\nFeel free to submit early, though—we can always iterate on this.\nTo run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you need to run the following command:\n$ uv run nox --session=pre-commit -- install\nIt is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything. This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.\n\n\n\n\nOpen a new branch with the version name\nChange the version in pyproject.toml (you can run uv run version_bumper.py, which has script-level dependencies)\nCommit the change with a new version label as the commit message (checking the tests pass)\nHead to GitHub and merge into main (again, if the CI works)\nDraft a new release based on that most recent merge commit, using the new version as the tag\nConfirm the release draft on GitHub\nThe automatic release GitHub Action will push to PyPI.\n\nIf you ever need distributable files, you can use the uv build command locally.\n\n\n\nYou shouldn’t need to publish the documentation because there’s a GitHub action that covers it automatically whenever there’s a new release. But to upload the documentation manually, it’s\n\nRun make to build the documentation\nRun make publish to publish the documentation"
